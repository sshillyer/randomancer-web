# randomancer-web
A web-based random content generator for fantasy roleplaying games. Developed in Angular2.

Note that the CSS file should allow you to create basic D&D 5e Player Handbook style documents. It's not as full featured or easy to use as Homebrewery, but could help you style a simple page if you just want the CSS.
